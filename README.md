# kuncie's flutter coding test

## Getting Started

This project is created for kuncie's coding test.

To run this app you need to get a ```read access token``` from TMDB. Afterwards you need to follow these steps:
- You might need to generate localization file by running ```flutter gen-l10n```.
- If you're set you can run the app either by android studio run feature or terminal's command but you need to add this dart-define variable ```--dart-define=ACCESS_TOKEN=<READ_ACCESS_TOKEN>```, replace ```<READ_ACCESS_TOKEN>``` with your own ```read access token```
